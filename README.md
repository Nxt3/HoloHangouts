This is an EvolveSMS theme. I've included the PSD (Photoshop) files for each bubble.

If you use this as a base for any sort of future theme or if you modify this theme and redistribute it--I only as that you please give credit to me, Nate Gantt (iNate71). Also, I ask that you do not profit from this. If you redistribute the theme, it should be free. There is a reason I licensed this. ;)

That's all. Feel free to do whatever you want with it otherwise!

*Note: for some reason, the 9patches get really messed up after exporing the images in Photoshop. You'll have to go in and manually fix the 9-patches; there isn't anything I can do about it, sorry!*
